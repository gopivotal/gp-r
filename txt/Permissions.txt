## <a name="packages"/> Notes on permissions
R is an untrusted language [untrusted]. Only superusers can create functions in untrusted languages. A discussion as to whether granting super user privileges on the database is acceptable needs to be an explicit step in selecting PL/R for your analytics project. 

This is what happens when you try to create a PL/R function when you aren't a superuser:

``` 
ERROR:  permission denied for language plr

********** Error **********

ERROR: permission denied for language plr
SQL state: 42501
```

You do not need superuser priveleges to EXECUTE a PL/R function, only to CREATE a PL/R function. You can do:

Non-superusers *can run* a PL/R function that was created by a superuser. In the GP Admin Guide there is a section entitled 'Managing Object Privileges' which outlines how to grant priveleges to other roles.
